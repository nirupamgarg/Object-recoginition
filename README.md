# Object-recoginition

A simple Deep Learning CNN model made from cifar-10 dataset. It rtakes in a image input oand give a string naming the object in the image. Right now, it only consists of 10 objects(refer to the code for the object names).
The Code has been made into an app by @abhinavsri360 and the code to the application can be found in his repository linked here: [Object recognition](https://github.com/abhinavsri360/ObjectRecognizer)
